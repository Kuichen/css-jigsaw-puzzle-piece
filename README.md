Preface
=======

Originally this experiment was started as a challenge to succeed rendering a Jigsaw puzzle piece with pure CSS and I wasn't quite sure if it is possible at all, however surprisingly to me the first draft was extremely easy (see .jigsaw1 in index.html). Then I thought I have to take the challenge further and create exactly the same effect but with less HTML markup. It wasn't as hard too (see .jigsaw2 in index.html). So I decided to completely get rid of any extra markup and do it in one element ONLY! This was funny part, as I had to fail a lot untill I got to something that cannot be called complete success, but at least it got close. I definitely recommend using .jigsaw1 or .jigsaw2 if you are going to use it in production website. Do you think you can do it better? Let me know.
