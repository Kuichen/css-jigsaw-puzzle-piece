Pure CSS Jigsaw puzzle piece
====================

Originally this experiment was to me as a challenge to actually render Jigsaw puzzle piece with CSS and I wasn't sure if it is possible, however surprisingly it was very easy to start (see .jigsaw1 in index.html). Then I thought I have to take the challenge further and do same effect but with less HTML markup. It wasn't as hard too (see .jigsaw2 in index.html). So I decided to completely get rid of any extra markup and do it in one element ONLY! THis was funny part, as I had to pass lots of fails untill I got to something that cannot be called success, but at least it got close. I wonder if it can be done better, do you know how? Let me know.
